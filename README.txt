A simple RSS viewer for multiple feeds

- Put everything in a directory on your webserver;
- Open rssviewer.html in your browser; it should show four RSS feeds (from Dutch newspapers 8-);
- You can change or add RSS feeds in the array at the top of the rssviewer.js file;
- The script will automatically see how many feeds there are, process them, and show them.

A working demo (but a different version) can be found at http://www.den-uijl.nl/news/news.php.

- Note that a small php file is used to get around the same-origin policy. If you don't want to do that, don't use this.
